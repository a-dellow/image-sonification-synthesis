# image-sonification-synthesis
**BSc Sound Engineering Final Project**
This algorithm will take a digital image input, extract a signal from it and map it into the audio domain.
This signal can be used for sound synthesis purposes.
Currently, the idea is to apply this algorithm creatively by using a fingerprint scan as the digital image input. This provides unique input for any user and allows the user to create their **'own sound'**.

This repository will be continually updated as I progress with the code design and implementation.
